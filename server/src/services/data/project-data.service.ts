  /**
   * Fetches one or more pages of project data from the database and organizes the results into a page-number-keyed object.
   *
   * Each page consists of a list of `IProjectDetails` entries, combining the core project data (`Project`)
   * with its associated frameworks (`ProjectFrameworks`). Pages are retrieved in ascending order starting from `pageStart`.
   *
   * The operation stops early if an empty page is returned â€” this is treated as an indicator that there are no more
   * projects beyond that point in the database.
   *
   * ### Behavior:
   * - Pages are 1-indexed.
   * - If `pageEnd` is not provided, only the `pageStart` page is fetched.
   * - If filters are provided, the results will be limited accordingly.
   *
   * @param options An object containing:
   * - `pageStart` (number): The first page to fetch (inclusive, 1-indexed).
   * - `pageSize` (number): The number of projects per page.
   * - `pageEnd` (number, optional): The last page to fetch (inclusive). Defaults to `pageStart`.
   * - `isAscending (boolean, optional): Specifies the sorting order of the data before fetching.
   * - `filter` (IProjectFilter, optional): A filter to apply to the query (e.g., by language, type, etc.).
   *
   * @returns A promise resolving to a `Record<number, IProjectDetails[]>`, where each key is a page number
   * and each value is an array of fully-hydrated `IProjectDetails` entries (project + frameworks).
   *
   * @example
   * const result = await fetchProjectsPages({
   *   pageStart: 1,
   *   pageSize: 10,
   *   pageEnd: 3,
   *   filter: { LanguageId: 2 }
   * });
   *
   * // result might look like:
   * // {
   * //   1: [{ Project: ..., ProjectFrameworks: [...] }, ...],
   * //   2: [...],
   * //   3: [...]
   * // }
